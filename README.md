# dotfiles [DEPRECATED]

These are my dotfiles.
I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage different configurations on different machines.

## deprecation
As I found my setup to lean more and more towards defaults, and with various programs offering their own solutions to save settings into the cloud, I found the overhead of maintaining these files not worthwhile.
